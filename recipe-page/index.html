  </p>
  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust 1</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce, or more </li>
    <li>depending how much you like (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>
      1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li> 1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</li>
    <li>3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions: </h2>
  <ol>
    <h2>To make the dough: </h2>
    <li>Mix and knead together all of the dough ingredients, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, till you've created a
      soft, smooth dough.</li>
    <li>Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours; this will
      heighten the crust's flavor.</li>
    <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and divide it in half.</li>
    <li>Lightly grease two 12" to 14" rou1nd pizza pans; or a couple of baking sheets; or a couple of pieces of
      parchment (if you're going to bake on a stone).</li>
    <li>Shape each piece of dough into a 10" to 14" disk (thick crust vs. thin crust), and place in the prepared pans.</li>
    <li>Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 to 2 hours, till the crust is as puffy as you like.</li>
    <li>While the crust is rising, prepare the filling. And, towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to
      425°F.</li>
    <li>Lightly grease a frying pan or skillet, and sauté the pineapple till lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Remove the pineapple, and sauté the ham. While this step isn't strictly necessary, it intensifies the flavors,
      and helps keep the pizza from getting soggy from pineapple juice.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <h2>To prepare the pizzas: </h2>
    <li>Bake the pizza crusts, without toppings, for about 12 minutes, till they're set but not browned.K</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, and spread with tomato sauce. Layer with the pineapple and ham, then sprinkle with
      cheese.</li>
    <li>Return pizzas to the oven, and bake for an additional 12 to 16 minutes, till the crusts are brown and the
      cheese
      is melted and barely beginning to brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, and transfer to a rack.</li>
    <li> Slice and serve ASAP.</li>
  </ol>
