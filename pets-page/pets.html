          <h4 class="card-title">Robo Hamsters</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Roborovski hamster (Phodopus roborovskii; formerly Cricetulus bedfordiae), also known as
            desert hamster or Robo, is the smallest of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus, averaging under
            2
            centimetres (0.8 in) at birth and 4.5–5 centimetres (1.8–2.0 in) and 20–25 grams (0.71–0.88 oz) during
            adulthood.[2] Distinguishing characteristics of the Roborovskis are eyebrow-like white spots and the lack
            of
            any dorsal stripe (found on the other members of the genus Phodopus). The average lifespan for the
            Roborovski
            hamster is three years, though this is dependent on living conditions (extremes being four years in
            captivity
            and two in the wild).[3] Roborovskis are known for their speed and have been said to run an equivalent of
            four human marathons each night on average.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title">Guinea Pigs</h4>
          <p class="card-text">There are many breeds of guinea pig or cavy which have been developed since its
            domestication ca. 5000 BC. Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from show breeds with
            long,
            flowing hair to those in use as model organisms by science. From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the
            Inca Empire in 1532, selective breeding by indigenous South American people resulted in many landrace
            varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern, formal breeds.[1] Early
            Andean varieties were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the guinea
            pig
            as a food source continue to the modern era.</p>

            called
            betta fish or Siamese fighting fish. They are called Siamese fighting fish because people used to make them
            fight each other.[1] Betta splendens are native to Thailand. They are a popular aquarium fish species. They
            are known for their interesting behavior, bright colors, and ability to breath air.
